I am a graduate student in the [MSc in Applied Computing](https://mscac.utoronto.ca/) program at the [University of Toronto](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/) Department of Computer Science, specializing in machine learning. 

I have experience applying machine learning to problems in computer vision, 3D graphics, and fluid mechanics. I am interested in working on problems in vision, language and the natural sciences. 

**I am actively looking for full-time roles starting January 2024!**

**Previously:** I was an undergrad at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) in the [Interdisciplinary Dual Degree](https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/academics/dual-degree-program/) program majoring in Aerospace Engineering and Data Science, where I did research in machine learning for fluid simulations.
