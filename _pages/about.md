I am a graduate student in the [MSc in Applied Computing](https://mscac.utoronto.ca/) program at the [University of Toronto](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/) Department of Computer Science, specializing in machine learning. 

I am interested in applications of deep learning in the [physical sciences](https://www.nature.com/subjects/physical-sciences), as well as research on deep generative models, AI art creation, self-supervised learning and computer vision.

**Previously:** I was an undergrad at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) in the [Interdisciplinary Dual Degree](https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/academics/dual-degree-program/) program majoring in Aerospace Engineering and Data Science. I did research in machine learning for fluid simulations, and an internship at Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest beer company.

**I am actively looking for applied research internship opportunities starting May 2023!**
